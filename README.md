# Melanoma-Detection
 CNN-based melanoma detection project

A CNN-based melanoma detection project, initially a 2022 college minor project, now enhanced with focal loss for class imbalance, data augmentation, and fine-tuning. It includes data loading, class balancing, augmentation, and evaluation with precision, recall, and threshold tuning. Test image visualization provides performance insights.

Note: Tuning learning rate and epochs may improve results.
